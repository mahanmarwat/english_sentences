# English Sentences

1000+ frequently used english sentences to work with.

## Getting started

Here is an example:

```dart
import "package:english_sentences/english_sentences.dart";

var sentences = englishSentences.take(10)
for (var s in sentences) {
    print(s);
}
```

## End Notes

There is this `english_words` package, So I thought `english_sentences` package might be helpful.
